# Chrome Console
A Chrome extension* that shows console messages on the frontend. It's inspired by [toast.log](https://toastlog.com/), but this one's free! It allows passthrough of console messages, meaning that messages go to both the console and this extension*. It also lets you use the console for more "complex" console features, such as `console.table()` and `console.time()`. There's still a bit of work to do, but if you'd like to give it a try, just download this repository and open the `index.html` file for a demo.
